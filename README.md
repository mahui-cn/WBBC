# WBBC
Create admixture model files (*.F, *.alleles) based on WBBC project of West Lake University. Microarray chip files (TSV format) from popular genetic testing companies are used as referenced SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium SNPs could be eliminated. The output admixture model files could be used for model based admixture calculator such as https://geneu.xyz/user-profile
